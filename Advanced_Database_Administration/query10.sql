/* Write a script that creates and calls a stored procedure named test. 
This procedure should calculate the common factors of the numbers 10 and 20. 
To find a common factor, you can use the modulo operator (%) 
to check whether a number thatâ€™s less than 10 
can be evenly divided into both numbers. 
The procedure should return a 1 row, 1 column result set with a column named result.  
The return result should be a string that includes the common factors like this:
Common factors of 10 and 20: 1 2 5 10
