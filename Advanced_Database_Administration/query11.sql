/* Write a script that creates and calls a stored procedure named test. 
This stored procedure should create a cursor for a result set that consists 
of the product_name and list_price columns for each product with a 
list price thatâ€™s greater than $700. The rows in this result set 
should be sorted in descending sequence by list price. 
The procedure should return a 1 row, 1 column result set with a column named result.  
The procedure should set the return value to a string variable that includes 
the product_name and list price for each product so it looks something like this:
*Gibson SG*,*2517.00*|*Gibson Les Paul*,*1199.00*|
Here, each value is enclosed in asterisk(*), 
each column is separated by a comma (,) and each row is 
separated by a pipe character (|).
