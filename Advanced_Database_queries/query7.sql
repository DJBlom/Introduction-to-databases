/* Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns: email_address, 
order_id, and the order total for each customer. To do this, 
you can group the result set by the email_address and order_id columns. In addition, you must calculate the order total from the columns in the 
Order_Items table.

Write a second SELECT statement that uses the first SELECT statement 
in its FROM clause. The main query should return three columns: 
the customerâ€™s email address and the largest order (aliased as max_order_total) and the smallest order_id (aliased as min_order_id). 
To do this, you can group the result set by the email_address. 
Sort the result set by the largest order in descending sequence.  */
